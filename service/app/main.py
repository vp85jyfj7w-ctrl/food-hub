# No CORS middleware by default (security review, Jul 2026). Every browser
# client is same-origin: the web UI and kiosk pages fetch relative URLs, the
# phone QR flow opens the app's own address, and the setup wizard posts to its
# own origin. The headless clients (Home Assistant REST sensors, the satellite
# sync, the Stream Deck controller, the host bridge) are server-side HTTP with
# no CORS preflight at all. The old allow_origins=["*"] therefore served no
# client and only widened the browser attack surface (any web page could probe
# the LAN address and read whatever answers without a login). Same-origin is
# the browser default and strictly safer.
#
# A cross-origin browser client did eventually appear (FoodHub-barcode-bridge,
# Sept 2026): a page hosted elsewhere (e.g. Netlify) doing its own live
# barcode-camera scanning and posting the result to /pending/scan, built
# because the app's own scanner needs https and the only https address here
# is behind a proxy that the login flow treats as an internet origin and gates
# behind 2FA. Rather than weaken that login check, the external page
# authenticates with an X-API-Key instead of a session -- require_auth() below
# already grants API-key requests full access regardless of origin -- so the
# only thing missing was letting the BROWSER read the JSON response back
# cross-origin. Per the note above, that stays gated on an explicit allowlist,
# never "*", and never allows credentials (the API key travels as a header,
# not a cookie, so none are needed). The actual app.add_middleware call for
# this lives at the end of the middleware section, not here -- see the note
# by block_cross_site_writes for why CORS has to be the outermost middleware.
