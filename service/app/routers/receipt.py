"""Receipt price capture endpoints (FoodAssistant-5osx).

POST /receipt/analyze accepts a receipt photo and answers immediately: the
vision-provider read takes a minute or two, so it runs as a background task
(the fast-ack pattern from routers/pending.py) and the user is free to leave
the page. The finished result persists to the receipt_results state file
(services/receipt_jobs.py), raises an action item in the Review inbox, and
fires a kiosk toast, so it is waiting wherever the user went. GET
/receipt/status is what the Shopping page polls while it is open; POST
/receipt/dismiss clears a stored result; POST /receipt/apply stamps each
confirmed price onto the matched product's newest stock entry and clears the
stored result too. The pure logic (prompt, parse, matching, newest-entry
pick) lives in services/receipt.py; the job state in services/receipt_jobs.py.
